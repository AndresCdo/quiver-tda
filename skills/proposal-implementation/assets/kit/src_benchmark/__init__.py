"""Declares the experiment this benchmark package runs.

The harness stage copies this file in once, verbatim, only after a
comparison has been accepted, and substitutes nothing into it — every value
below is prefilled empty, and stays that way until a person fills it in as
the work happens.

Each of the five blocks is prefilled empty on purpose, and only at this level.
Emptiness at the block level is unambiguous: no repository ever means "I
measured that `distribution` is empty" before a single shard has run. One
level down that stops being true — a replication run can measure that
`perEnvironment` is genuinely `[]`, and a template that had already written
`[]` there would be indistinguishable from that measurement. So the shape of
what belongs inside each block is described in a comment beside it, never
written as a value, and nothing here invents a value for `arms`, `search`,
`report` or `distribution` — those are read off the work as it happens, not
guessed at scaffold time.

`revision` and `premises` are declared alongside this package, not inside it:
they are facts about the METHOD this benchmark compares against a baseline,
not about the comparison, so they live in `__implementation__` under
`src/<Package>/__init__.py` (`authored_package_init`'s own template) instead.
`__levels__`, `__steps__` and `__records__` — the target's own first-flow
declarations — moved there too, for the identical reason.

__benchmark__ = {
    # One entry per arm, naming the sections of the proposal it exercises,
    # e.g.:
    #     "arms": {

    #         "proposed": {"sections": ["3.1", "3.4"]},

    # What a declared search has to say about itself before its chosen value
    # means anything, e.g.:
    #     "search": {
    #         "what": "the regularization weight",
    #         "requiredScale": {"epochs": 20, "seeds": 3},

    # One key is OPTIONAL and asked of nobody, and it is the one every
    # later reading hangs off: `record`, the path -- relative to the
    # product folder -- of the artefact this search writes, e.g.:
    #     "record": "Results/search-record.json"
    # Leave it out and `search.recordFound` answers `null` forever: a
    # ticked `@record` witness has nothing behind it, a leveled
    # `@record:level` one reaches no rung, and `probe` keeps answering
    # `search-first` because a declared `requiredScale` cannot be
    # satisfied by a record nothing was told to look for. The forge never
    # guesses the filename; you name it, and it only looks.
    #
    # A second key is likewise OPTIONAL: `currentWhen`, a
    # dotted path into the record's own file naming where it wrote down the
    # identity of the code that produced it, e.g.:
    #     "currentWhen": "evidence.sourcesDigest"
    # `distribution.currentWhen`'s own idiom, one level up from a shard.
    # Declare it and a found record only counts as evidence while the value
    # there still matches the code as it stands; a record left behind by
    # code this repository has moved past reads as unmeasured rather than as
    # a rung reached. Leave it out -- the default -- and a found record is
    # trusted on arrival alone, exactly as before this key existed. The
    # forge never guesses the field, the same way it never guesses which
    # measurements are poolable: you name it, and it only compares.

    # What a run split across shards has to say about itself: the axis a
    # shard is a subset of, and which measurements are poolable, measured
    # per environment, vary per run, or must agree identically across every
    # shard, e.g.:
    #     "distribution": {
    #         "axis": "seed",
    #         "poolable": ["accuracy"],

    #         "identicalAcrossShards": ["datasetSize"],
    #     }
    #
    # One further key is OPTIONAL and asked of nobody: `currentWhen`, a
    # dotted path into a shard's own `shard.json` stamp naming where that
    # shard wrote down the identity of the code that produced it, e.g.:
    #     "currentWhen": "evidence.sourcesDigest"
    # Declare it and a returned shard only counts as evidence while the
    # value there still matches the code as it stands; a shard that arrived
    # from code this repository has moved past reads as unmeasured rather
    # than as a step reached. Leave it out -- the default -- and a shard is
    # trusted on arrival alone, exactly as before this key existed. The
    # forge never guesses the field, the same way it never guesses which
    # measurements are poolable: you name it, and it only compares.
    #
    # A second, sibling key is likewise OPTIONAL: `shardsRoot`, naming
    # where a split campaign's returned shards land, relative to this
    # repository's own root (an absolute path is honoured as given), e.g.:
    #     "shardsRoot": "campaign-001/shards"
    # Declare it once and every command that reads a position section --
    # not only the ones that carry their own `--shards` flag -- measures a
    # `@shard` witness against that same directory automatically; a `@shard`
    # item ticked on real evidence stays checkable everywhere, not only at
    # the one command that was told where to look for it. An explicit
    # `--shards <dir>`, where the command accepts one, still overrides this
    # for that single invocation. Leave it out -- the default -- and a
    # command with no `--shards` flag of its own reads a `@shard` witness as
    # unmeasured, exactly as before this key existed; the forge never
    # invents a directory a repository never named.
