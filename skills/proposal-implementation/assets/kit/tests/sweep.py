"""Randomized configuration sweep shared by the audit and the remedy checks.

One fixed size for every claim: a property surviving SWEEP_SIZE independent
configurations belongs to the formulation, not to a seed.

SWEEP_BASE offsets the block by the run's seed so separate runs audit disjoint
configurations. Without it, agreement between runs would confirm determinism
and nothing else.

`configuration` builds one instance of whatever the proposal's objects are.
Vary what the proposal allows to vary — cardinalities, dispersion, shifts — so
a claim that only holds for one shape shows up as a rate below the full sweep.

Backend-neutral on purpose: no array library is imported here, so this file
never decides the implementation's backend (`__backend__` in
`src/<Package>/__init__.py` does). `configuration_seed(index)` is the seed of
one configuration; build the backend's own generator from it, e.g.
`numpy.random.default_rng(configuration_seed(index))` or
`torch.Generator().manual_seed(configuration_seed(index))`.
