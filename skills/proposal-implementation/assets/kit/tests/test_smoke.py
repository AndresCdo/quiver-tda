"""Level 1 - smoke. Does it run at all, on the smallest input?

Smoke never asserts mathematics; it asserts the code is reachable and every
public entry point returns something of the right shape. Mathematical claims
belong in test_invariants.py.

Until step 9 has run, this file is red on purpose: `MODULES` names a module
nobody has written yet, and `REVISION` the revision step 8 declares.
The engine's `--stage objects` (SKILL.md step 9) fills both in once they
are known.
