"""Deterministic fixtures. Fixed seed, no data, no network.

The seed is chosen per run so that levels 2 and 3 vary between runs while
staying reproducible within one.

Backend-neutral on purpose: this file imports no array library, so it never
decides which backend the implementation computes with (`src/<Package>/
__init__.py`'s `__backend__` does). Build the backend's own generator from
`SEED` where a test needs one, e.g. `numpy.random.default_rng(SEED)` or
`torch.Generator().manual_seed(SEED)`.
