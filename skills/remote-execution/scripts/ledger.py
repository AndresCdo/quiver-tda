"""Append-only ledger for forge-owned remote execution.

A submission to a remote worker is a fact once it happens, and facts are not
edited — only added to. This module owns the append path — appending one
JSON-encoded event to `<target>/<Name>/.remote-execution/ledger.jsonl`, one
line per event, opened `O_APPEND`, never rewritten and never deleted — and
the fold: deriving "what is the current state of this entrypoint" from that
log, including the currency rule that tells a fresh result from a stale one.
No mutable "current status" record is ever stored; every answer `fold()`
gives is recomputed from the log each time it is called.

Ledger CODE is forge-owned. Ledger DATA lives inside the target's own git
checkout, because it is a per-repository record of what that repository
submitted, not something the forge should hold on anyone's behalf.

Why an append is trustworthy at all rests on four things held together, and
only two of them are this module's job:

- `O_APPEND` on a regular, local file makes seek-to-end-and-write atomic as a
  unit with respect to other appenders, so two concurrent writers cannot
  interleave into the same region. That guarantee is unconditional; it does
  not depend on any buffer-size constant, `PIPE_BUF` included.
- The return value of `os.write()` is checked against the byte count, and a
  mismatch raises. A write CAN legitimately return short, and a short write
  is exactly what tears a JSONL line. This check is the actual defence
  against that, not the append call's mere existence.
- No `io` buffering: `open(path, "a")` may split one logical write across
  syscalls, which would reintroduce the interleaving `O_APPEND` exists to
  prevent. `append()` here always goes through `os.open`/`os.write` on a raw
  fd, one `os.write()` per event.
- Local filesystem only — NFS does not honor `O_APPEND` atomicity. That is a
  precondition stated in `SKILL.md`, not something this module can enforce.

    to the same ledger can disagree about the time, and sorting by a value
    one of them wrote would reorder events the filesystem's `O_APPEND`
    already ordered correctly. `lines` is trusted to already be in that
    order — the order the caller read them off disk — and this function
    does not second-guess it.

    `live_digest` is the source digest to judge recorded submissions
    against, taken as data rather than computed in here. This module stays

    this whole skill is `remote_cli -> packer -> ledger -> adapter`, one

    compute a fresh digest passes a string; if computing one is not free, it

    at most once per call — not once per event or per entrypoint.

    resubmission lands, even though the log line itself never changes. Since
    `fold()` is a batch computation that can run long after every event in

    Both halves below are load-bearing, but not for every backend equally
    (Part C2) — each covers a different class:

    - `superseded` (id-equality) catches a resubmission at an UNCHANGED
      digest — a retry after a service failure, where the source never
      moved but an older submission id is no longer the one that matters.
      Digest-equality alone would miss this: the old submission's recorded
      digest still equals the live one, so a digest-only check would call
      its result current. This half is load-bearing for a FRESH-ID-PER-CALL
      backend (every `submit()` mints a new, distinct id) — proved
      reachable by `test_resubmission_at_unchanged_digest_still_marks_
      earlier_result_stale`. On an IDENTITY-STABLE backend (Kaggle-shaped:
      the same `(worker, entrypoint)` always mints the same id), this half
      is structurally INERT: `by_id[id]` and `latest[(entrypoint, worker)]`
      resolve to the SAME record once ids repeat, so `latest_for_key !=
      submission` can never be true — pinned by
      `test_retry_at_unchanged_digest_under_a_stable_id_reads_current`. Its
      guarding duty does not vanish there; it relocates to `fold()`'s
      append-position checks — BOTH of them, not just one: the
      `entrypoints`-settle loop (Part B) protects `pending_for()`/the
      packer clamp, and a SEPARATE positional check in the verdicts loop
      (immediately after this function is called, guarding only its
      `"current"` answers) protects `LedgerState.verdicts` and
      `from_stale_submission` — the field `remote_cli.py` surfaces
      directly as the CLI's `"quarantined"` output. An earlier version of
      this docstring named only the `entrypoints` relocation; that
      understated the claim; verify report `sdd/the-id-that-repeats-
      by-construction/verify-report` (engram #1134) traced the gap to a
      consumer this docstring had not accounted for. Both relocations are
      proved by the SAME test,
      `test_positional_guard_catches_what_id_equality_
      would_catch_on_a_fresh_id_backend`, which asserts on
      `entrypoints`, `verdicts`, AND `from_stale_submission` together.
    - `sourceMoved` (digest-equality) catches the opposite: the same
      submission is still the latest one on record — no resubmission
      happened — yet the source has moved again since it was submitted.
      Id-equality alone would miss this: the id still matches the latest
      one, so an id-only check would call this result current too. This
      half is load-bearing for BOTH backend classes: it is orthogonal to
      how ids are minted.

    `latest` is keyed by `(entrypoint, worker)` (Decision 6): this reads
    only the SAME worker's own latest submission for this entrypoint, so a
    different worker's resubmission of the same entrypoint can never mark
    this one superseded. A caller passing an old, entrypoint-only-keyed
    `latest` dict fails CLOSED here, not open: `.get()` on a mismatched key
    shape finds nothing, `latest_for_key` is `None`, and the submission is
    over-quarantined as superseded rather than falsely admitted as current.

    Either check alone lets a superseded result read as current, which is
    the one defect class this whole ledger exists to prevent. A submission
    this log never recorded (a defensive case that should not arise given
    `submission` always comes from `by_id`) is treated as superseded rather
    than current — this rule fails closed, not open.
