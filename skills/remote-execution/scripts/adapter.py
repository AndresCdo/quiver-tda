"""The remote-execution adapter seam.

This module defines the ABC every backend-specific adapter must satisfy in
full, the frozen data shapes that cross the seam in either direction, and a
small name-to-class registry so a caller can select a backend by a string
without importing it directly.

Nothing here knows what any backend is called or how it talks over the
network. That knowledge is confined to exactly one file per backend, living
below this seam. This module is the boundary that makes swapping one such
file for another a no-op for everything above it: the ledger, the packer,
and the CLI depend on this interface only, never on a concrete adapter class.

A second backend, if one is ever added, would expose exactly four places
this seam could otherwise leak its details through. Each shape below states,
next to the field it concerns, the rule that keeps it from doing so:

- `Submission.id` — opaque outside the adapter that issued it.
- `Status.state` — the seam's own vocabulary, never a backend's raw text.
- `Job.run_config` — an opaque mapping the adapter interprets; the packer
  and the ledger never read or branch on a key inside it.
- `Worker.capacity` — concurrent jobs per worker, not a backend's own
  metering unit.
