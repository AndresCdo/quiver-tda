"""paper_bib: `paper/refs.bib` built exclusively from cached, resolved
metadata, so "never hand-typed" is a checked property rather than a claim
(`no-claim-without-a-source-that-holds-it`, `sourced-bibliography` spec).

`entry_from_record` is the SOLE entry producer -- no function or CLI flag
anywhere in this skill accepts caller-composed entry text. Handing this
module a finished entry would replace a human typing with a model typing
and degrade "never hand-typed" from a checked property to a claim
(`design.md`, Decision 4).

`no-citation-before-its-paper-is-ingested` (item 2) adds a second, stricter
requirement on top of "resolved": a citation's cached metadata may not
reach `refs.bib` until the paper it cites has actually been ingested.
Resolution and ingestion are two independent facts about the same
citation -- a DOI can resolve against OpenAlex/Crossref while the PDF
itself still sits unread on someone's desk -- so `entry_from_record` checks
both, never conflating "the metadata is real" with "the source is here to
be quoted from".

The match between a resolved record and an ingested paper is NEVER a guess
from `identifier`/`resolver` against a folder name: a resolved DOI or
arXiv id and a `guidance/<root>/<paper>/` folder name have no free
correspondence, and pairing them by string similarity risks silently
citing the WRONG paper's metadata against the RIGHT paper's ingested text
(`design.md`; the launch context's own warning). Instead this module reuses
the one link that is already exact: `record["source_md"]`, the literal path
`paper_evidence.EvidenceSpan.locate` verified a real quote against when the
evidence record was built (`validate --quote ... --source-md ...`). A
record whose evidence span was never located against any ingested file
(`source_md` empty -- `verdict == "insufficient"`, or a hand-built record)
carries no such link and refuses; a `source_md` that does not resolve to
`guidance/<root>/<paper>/<paper>.md` -- the exact two-level shape
`paper_guidance.ingested_papers` walks -- refuses the same way, because
that shape IS what "ingested" means in this skill (`paper-ingestion`
SKILL.md). No second, independent classifier is introduced.
