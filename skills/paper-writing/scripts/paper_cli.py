"""paper_cli.py — front door for the `paper-writing` skill.

Standard library only, keyless, offline, fail-closed — the shape of
`implementation_cli.py` and `remote_cli.py`. One JSON object on stdout per
invocation. Exit 0 means the command ran; exit 2 means a guard refused
before touching disk.

Wires twenty-five verbs: `scaffold`, `open`, `status`, `substitute` (from
`only-the-block-changes`; `substitute` grew an optional `--contract <path>`
in Slice C1 of `the-paper-carries-its-own-decisions`, recording provenance
without changing what bytes get written); `contract`, `readiness`, `order`
(from `the-contract-is-data-not-code` — the section-contract reader);
`declare`, `observe`, `plan` (from `the-paper-carries-its-own-decisions`,
Slices B and C2 — `observe` validates an `insumos-observer` report against
the observable-fact schema before a human runs `declare` against it);
`bind` (from `the-requirement-names-the-section-that-feeds-it`, U3e ruling
— the verb that RECORDS a `source-section-binding`, in `paper/`, never
`sections/*.md`: the answer to `SECTION_BINDING_ABSENT` a person gives BY
USING THE SKILL, never by a hand edit or an agent reading conversation
prose; `--reopen` clears an already-recorded (block, fact) pair);
`resolve`, `full_text`, `bib build`, `validate` (from `no-claim-without-a-
source-that-holds-it`, WU1/WU2/WU3, and `the-pdf-arrives-or-the-operator-
is-told` for `full_text` — `resolve` is the one path that makes this CLI
not offline end to end, keyless and behind a role `papersmith.yaml` can
empty; `full_text` fills the sibling `full-text` role the same way,
fetching an already-resolved record's own PDF from its cached metadata's
measured `full_text_url` and placing it loose under `guidance/<section-
id>/` for `paper-ingestion` to find; `bib build` rebuilds `refs.bib` whole
from cached resolved metadata only; `validate` is the single gate deciding
verdict, placement and the bounded search-round budget before any block
reaches disk, now counting each claim's DISTINCT source papers against a
configurable minimum (`paper_validate.DEFAULT_MIN_SOURCES_PER_CLAIM`,
`the-pdf-arrives-or-the-operator-is-told`, item 2), never bare record
count); `write` (from `the-
writer-may-assert-only-what-it-was-given` — a judge, never an invoker: it
reconciles an already-shuttled redactor draft and contract-auditor account
against one block's real contract, evidence set and mode, and either
substitutes the block or reports why not, with exactly one bounded
re-draft); `render`, `place` (from `a-diagram-that-compiles-or-says-why` —
a diagram that compiles standalone or says why, the repair-budget ledger,
and the data-figure boundary); `verify` (from `the-couplings-hold-or-they-
do-not` — a read-only report over five cross-section couplings, citation
integrity and contract currency; resolves the corpus's own optional-block
ids and threads them into `paper_verify.run`, so an unopened `optional:
true` block excuses a coupling as `unmeasured` rather than failing it); and
`phases`, `skeleton`, `packet` (from `the-phases-are-derived-not-
remembered` — `phases` reports each Kahn wave's own readiness basis and
gates `write` against it, `PHASE_NOT_READY`; `skeleton` infers Related Work
/ dataset-placement decisions straight from disk and opens every
non-excluded block id in derived order, once, never re-asking,
`SKELETON_ANSWER_REQUIRED`/`SKELETON_ALREADY_DECIDED`; `packet` assembles
one block's own contract prose plus, per `style-reference` guidance folder,
a heading OUTLINE only — offsets, never inlined span text — ahead of
`write`'s draft stage); and `reuse`, `exhaustion` (from
`a-leftover-paper-is-offered-before-it-is-lost` — two read-only reports
over the ingested-papers lifecycle: `reuse` names, for one block's own
still-open claims, which already-ingested `evidence`-classed papers carry
no verdict yet; `exhaustion` is the corpus-wide report of which papers now
carry a `does-not-hold` against every open claim in the whole corpus —
`paper_lifecycle.py` does every real read; this file only resolves paths
and threads `--min-sources` through. Neither verb ever deletes anything —
the operator deletes by hand, per the operator's own ruling). Left
extensible on purpose; nothing here assumes it is the last verb this file
will ever grow.

    (`enforce_bindings=False`, so an undecided binding elsewhere never
    blocks this read-only verb) and reuse its OWN `source_roots` for
    `paper_graph.resolve_section_index` -- one corpus assembly, not two,
    since `Corpus.source_roots` already carries everything that function
    needs (a deliberate refinement over assembling the corpus a second
    time just to recompute the identical dict); (3) derive the claimable
    set (`paper_separation.claimable_sections`) -- an UNMEASURED claimable
    set refuses `SEPARATION_SECTION_UNCLAIMABLE` immediately, before any
    per-title check, because there is no structure to resolve a title
    against at all; (4) per-title existence/ambiguity
    (`SECTION_NOT_IN_SOURCE`/`SECTION_TITLE_AMBIGUOUS`, the SAME checks
    `bind` already uses) then claimability
    (`SEPARATION_SECTION_UNCLAIMABLE`) for every named title, before any
    scoring runs; (5) anchor every assignment against the corpus's own
    `requires_facts` (unanchored ones are reported, never deleted or
    invented, and clear no orphan) and score (`paper_separation.
    score_cut`); (6) `concedes_to_round`, when given, is verified BEFORE
    anything is recorded (`_check_separation_concession`,
    `SEPARATION_ROUND_ABSENT`/`SEPARATION_CONCESSION_REGRESSED`); (7)
    EVERY structurally-valid round records now, whatever its score
    (`paper_declarations.record_separation_round`, U3) -- Decision F/G:
    `separate` writes ONLY `kind="separation"`, never a `binding`, under
    any outcome; (8) a score-0 cut returns naming the exact `bind`
    invocation for every assignment, and any nonzero total raises the ONE
    structural refusal fixed precedence names, naming the round just
    recorded (`_raise_separation_refusal`).

    not, until this change: `cmd_write` needs this corpus back to resolve
    a block's own bound sections (`paper_source_span.resolve_bound_
    sections`), never a second, independent assembly of the same corpus.
    Returned on every path, including the early `return` below, since a
    `qualified_id` outside every wave is still a real block `cmd_write`'s
    own downstream lookup goes on to resolve.

    Resolves `qualified_id`'s own Kahn wave via `paper_graph.derive_
    waves` and calls `_refuse_on_incomplete_waves`, the SAME gate
    computation `compute_phases`'s own `--phase N` refusal uses -- so
    `phases` and `write` can never disagree about what "not ready" means
    (Unit 6's own Notes flagged exactly this drift; this closes it).

    A `qualified_id` the corpus's own waves do not contain (a typo'd
    `--section`/`--block`, or a block the section header does not
    declare) is left to `cmd_write`'s existing downstream lookup to
    refuse on its own terms -- this gate only ever narrows what CAN
    proceed, it never invents a refusal for a condition it was not asked
    to police.

    `enforce_bindings=True` (U3b correctness repair, design.md Decision
    H): this is the ONLY `assemble_corpus` call in the whole skill that
    passes it. Every read-only verb assembles the SAME corpus with the
    default `False` and reports an unbound bindable entry as
    `Corpus.undecided_bindings` rather than refusing -- drafting a block
    without knowing which section feeds it is the one moment an
    undecided binding must become `SECTION_BINDING_ABSENT` instead of a
    report, so only `write`'s own gate ever turns it into one.

    `enforce_for_block=qualified_id` (U4 correctness repair, design.md:
    "the block this `write` call names, nothing else"): scopes that
    refusal to the block THIS call is actually about to draft. A sibling
    block elsewhere in the corpus carrying its own undecided binding --
    optional, unopened, or simply not yet reached -- stays visible in
    `Corpus.undecided_bindings` but no longer blocks writing a block that
    never named it. `qualified_id` is already resolved above this

    no new resolution, only narrows which entry can raise.

    it is the gate: a `style-reference` root whose ingested markdown
    cannot be read refuses `GUIDANCE_MARKDOWN_UNREADABLE` here, before the
