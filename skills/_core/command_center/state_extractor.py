"""Read-only derivation of a PaperSmith workspace's observable state.

``get_workspace_state(root)`` walks the workspace once and returns one JSON
payload describing paper metadata, the section lifecycle, the four quality
gates, the pipeline stages, and the evidence/inbox ledgers.

Design rules, in priority order:

1. **Read-only.** Nothing here opens a file for writing, creates a directory,
   or resolves a lock. The command center observes a paper; it never edits one.
2. **Best-effort.** A malformed contract, an unreadable draft, or a missing
   workspace config degrades exactly one field. Every reader is guarded and the
   payload always carries the documented top-level keys.
3. **Honest status.** ``SCAFFOLDED``/``CONTRACTED``/``DRAFTING``/``AUDITED``/
   ``SEALED`` are derived from bytes on disk (frontmatter, block markers,
   citation placeholders, compiled outputs), never inferred from a task list.
