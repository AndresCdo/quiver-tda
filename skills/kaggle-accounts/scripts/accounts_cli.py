"""Kaggle credentials: prove they work, keep the ones that do, drop the rest.

The user supplies the credentials by hand — a `kaggle.json` downloaded from
Kaggle, or a `.txt`/`.md` list with one `username key` per line, left in the inbox. That
being manual is what this is *for*: the work worth automating is not moving a
file, it is answering **does this account actually authenticate**, which is a
question only Kaggle can answer and one that stops being true over time.

So there are two operations and no more. ``validate`` re-checks every stored
account and takes in whatever is new, keeping only what authenticates.
``remove`` deletes what you no longer want. Everything else — ``list``,
``discover`` — exists to build the choices for those two.

Validating is not a setup step. Tokens get expired and rotated, and an account
that quietly stopped working does not fail when you add it; it fails hours later
in the middle of a run. That is why the stored accounts are re-checked every
time, not just the new ones.

An account is its Kaggle username. There is no alias: a second name for the same
thing buys nothing and gives you two ways to refer to one account, one of which
is always the wrong one.

The store lives inside the repository, so a `.gitignore` is the only thing
standing between a token and a public commit. That makes the ignore rule a
**precondition**, not a courtesy: before writing, this asks git whether the
store path is genuinely ignored, and refuses to write if it is not. Checking the
effective answer beats checking that a file exists, because an ignore rule can
be present and still not match.

Keys are write-only from the outside. ``list`` reports usernames and never the
key, so an agent driving this CLI can offer you a choice of accounts without the
secret ever crossing into its context. Whatever launches the runs reads the
store directly.

A fourth command, ``materialize``, exists for code rather than a human at a
terminal: it writes one worker's stored credential to a plain-text token
file, atomically, and prints back where — never what. Nothing about it opens
a question; it is the one non-interactive way a credential this store
already holds reaches a file another process's own client can point itself
at.

Usage:
    python accounts_cli.py validate                 # re-check the store, take in the inbox
    python accounts_cli.py validate <file>…         # check these instead
    python accounts_cli.py validate --interactive   # run this one yourself, in a terminal
    python accounts_cli.py remove <username>…
    python accounts_cli.py list [--json]
    python accounts_cli.py discover [--json]
    python accounts_cli.py materialize --worker <username> [--into <dir>] --json

Exit codes: 0 everything checked out, 1 at least one account failed or was
rejected (the rest are stored), 2 usage/store/environment error (nothing was
written).

    The one command in this file that ever lets a stored credential leave

    that has already proven it is safe to hold one. Everything this prints
    is a destination, never a value: a caller learns WHERE a credential
    landed, not what it says.

    The file holds nothing but the token itself — no `username` field, no
    JSON wrapper. Kaggle's own client reads `KAGGLE_API_TOKEN` as a path,
    treats whatever text is at that path (stripped) as the token, and
    authenticates it through its modern token path. The legacy `kaggle.json`
    container (`{"username": ..., "key": ...}`) routes an access token
    through a Basic-auth path a bearer token was never meant for, and Kaggle
    answers that with 401 regardless of how valid the token is — so this
    command emits the shape Kaggle's client actually expects for the token
    format this store holds.

    Non-interactive by construction: there is no prompt, no confirmation,
    no branch that ever asks a human anything. The "one interactive
    question" doctrine that shapes `validate --interactive` governs the
    human consent surface this file opens, not the total count of commands
    it exposes — `list` and `discover` already answer without asking, and
    this is a third.

    Reuses `save_store()`'s own atomic shape exactly, because a half-written
    token file would be exactly the failure that shape already prevents
    for the store itself: `mkstemp` inside the destination, `os.fchmod` to
    owner-only BEFORE any byte is written, then `os.replace` — so a reader
    either finds the previous file or the new one, never a partial one.

#: **Arrival is every account carrying a CURRENT verdict, not a command that
#: ran.** That is the whole of it: a stored credential is a claim, and the only

#: rotated and expired -- so "it authenticated once" is not the arrival either.
#: A session that runs `validate`, sees a failure reported, and stops has not
#: arrived: a dead credential is reported and never removed here, deliberately,
#: because removing it is the user's other option and not a side effect of
