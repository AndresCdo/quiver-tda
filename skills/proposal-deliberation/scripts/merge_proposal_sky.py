"""Merge a proposal into the SOTA constellation: one atlas, two domains.

Reads the constellation ``check_atlas.py`` already passed
(``sota-pool/atlas.json``) and the proposal's own overlay
(``proposals/<revision>.sky.json``, written during the deliberation), and writes
one atlas: every SOTA system and link untouched and in its original order, plus
the proposal as one more system and its links into the constellation.

The merge is data, not a second picture. The proposal enters the sky its
references already live in, so "this idea extends that result" is a drawn edge
between two real nodes instead of a sentence in a document that can drift from
the graph it claims to describe. Reusing the constellation's own viewer is what
makes the relationship visible at all.

The merged file is what ``render_atlas.py --title ...`` draws, and it still has
to pass ``check_atlas.py``. This tool therefore refuses only what makes the
merge *incoherent* -- a system id already taken, a link with no planet to land
on -- and never restates the constellation's own bound, which already has one
authority.

Overlay shape::

    {"system": {"id": "proposal", "title": ..., "planets": [...]},
     "links": [{"from": <proposal planet id>, "to_system": ..., "to": ...,
                "rel": ...}]}

``from_system`` is deliberately absent from the overlay: every overlay link
starts at the proposal, so a field that can only ever hold one value is a way to
be wrong rather than a way to be expressive. The written link carries it.

Exit 0 on a written file, 1 when the overlay cannot be merged into a coherent
atlas, 2 on usage, unreadable input or invalid JSON. Stdlib only.
