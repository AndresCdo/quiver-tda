#!/usr/bin/env python3
# This skill's entry point into the shared implementation engine.
#
# The engine under `_core/` serves no domain of its own and refuses to start
# without one, so the only thing this file does is name which domain is asking
# before handing over. Every argument, subcommand and exit code is the engine's.
#
# `setdefault` rather than `=`: an explicit IMPLEMENTATION_DOMAIN_PROFILE in
# the environment is a deliberate override (a test fixture profile) and must
# win over the default -- the same `??=` semantics
# `proposal-deliberation/cli.mjs` uses, including for the empty string, which
# stays empty and is refused.
#
# One inherited value is never deliberate: another skill's own profile, left
# exported by a shell or by an earlier process that ran the other skill. Under
# it this skill would read the other skill's documents and holder, silently.
# It is refused here, before the engine loads, naming both profiles.
#
# "Another skill's profile" is decided by the skill the profile itself
# declares -- the skill directory of its `PROFILE["cli"]["path"]` launcher --
# so a sibling's profile from a different skills tree (another checkout or
# workspace) is refused too, while this skill's own profile is accepted
# wherever it lives. A sibling in this tree is still refused by path even
# when it cannot be loaded. A profile this launcher cannot read declares
# nothing here; the engine refuses it on load.
